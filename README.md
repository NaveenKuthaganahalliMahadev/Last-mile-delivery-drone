# Last-mile-delivery-drone

INTRODUCTION:

These days we are pretty habituated of home-delivery system through e-commerce platform, however there is a big dependency on delivery boys and vehicles for timely delivery of the items.With the rise in the number of vehicles on the road, it is becoming a hassle for delivering products on time. We could potentially use Drones for last mile delivery of items. While current prevalent addressing mechanism such as lat/long and post code are good enough for humans, these won’t work for drone delivery as all houses in a multi-story building will have same lat/long or post-code. We have designed a solution which can help drones to identify each address/flat as a separate unit and deliver the item accordingly. It will include a GPS module for tracking, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance, an altimeter for determining the altitude of flight and a gyro sensor for countering any imbalance during flight. Six brush-less DC motors will be used so that heavy equipment can be carried with ease. A camera will assist the deployer to have a visual overview of the drone in action.

#AdditionalInfo

Drones can be made to travel and deliver goods faster in the optimized path saving time and fuel. On- road delivery can take many zig-zag paths to reach the destination wasting time and energy.It can also be used for delivering medical and food supplies during emergencies like accidents or natural calamities. Multiple drones can be used to work as a network by having many base stations close by.
